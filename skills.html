                <p class="brief-skills">I have learned allot about computers and programming over the past two years, which I break down for you below. 
                    I am still continuing to learn and grow as a programmer by putting in at least 12hrs a week to enhancing my projects or learning a new skill.

            <h1>JAVA</h1>
            <p class="brief-skills">Java is my most studied skill with more than one year of dedicated training that was broken up into 3 parts. One part was from Salt 
                Lake Community College where I learned the basics of java. The other Two parts were at the University of Utah where I learned advanced java, and was 
                introduced to basic algorithms and data structure along with how to program with a partner. Below are links to the code repository of two of the projects
                 we worked on together using Eclipse IDE.

            <h1>Web Development</h1>
            <p class="brief-skills">I am currently focused on growing what I know of web development by creating this web site and learning all the tools of the trade. 
                I took one course from Salt Lake Community College about web development and found in very useful, but I did not want to enhance those skills until now. 
                I built this site using Visual Studios (HTML5 and CSS3) and have it hosted on Netlify (Integrated with Github).  Github repository is linked below.

                NetBeans, Notepad++, JavaScript, and CompTIA A+ (Have Certification). Besides the technical skills I have also learned allot of personal skill, communication

                 tasks assigned, punctuality, engaging co-workers and customers, managing time effectively, and most importantly problem-solving skills. Below is a link to my
