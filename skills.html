            <p class="brief-skills">The one class I took about 2 years ago felt outdated so I have been working on my HTML5 and CSS3 skills to get them
                up to date with current practices. Below is the code for this website when I have more examples, I will post them.

            <p class="brief-skills">I have taken many other programing classes which include, MYSQL, CompTIA A+ (Have Certification), and Microsoft EXCEL. 
                I must admit I have not used these skills recently, but I am confident that with practices these skills will come back. (Just like my HTML and CSS skills)
                besides those mentioned above I have over 10 years of experience working with people (customer and team alike) though my long career with Smiths link to more
                info on that below.
